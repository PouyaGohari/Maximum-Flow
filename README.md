## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of graph-based algorithms designed to solve maximum flow problems using Dijkstra's algorithm. The maximum flow problem is a fundamental question in network flow theory and has applications in various fields such as transportation, telecommunication, and computer networking.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of C++ (or the relevant programming language).
- You have a basic understanding of graph algorithms and data structures.

## Installation

To clone and run this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PouyaGohari/Maximum-Flow.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Maximum-Flow
## Usage

To compile and run the algorithms, use the following commands:

1. Compile the code:
   ```sh
   g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./output_file'

Replace output_file with the name you want for the compiled file and source_file.cpp with the name of the source file you want to compile.
